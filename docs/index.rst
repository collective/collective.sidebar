Sidebar Links (portal_actions)
------------------------------

The sidebar links are configured through the Plone ``portal_actions`` menu in the ZMI.

To change the links displayed in the sidebar, navigate to your Plone instance in the ZMI (you must be logged in as an administrator) and then the ``sidebar_links (Sidebar Links)`` action category.

Here you can either add a new ``CMF Action`` or edit / delete any of the existing links displayed in the sidebar. It is recommended to leave the default actions for the sake of usability though.
